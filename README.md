Repliclade is a simulator of evolution in gene families.
A Rust clone of the original code written in Python https://github.com/hakidehari/RepliClade as part of my Master's thesis at UWW.
I have decided to write it in Rust for 2 reasons:

  1.  As a learning experience for the Rust programming language.
  2.  Rust is faster.


This is still a work in progress.  A proper readme will be created once the application is functional in Rust.
